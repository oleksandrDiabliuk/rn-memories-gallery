    ReactNative: Native Image Editor (Android/iOS)

If this project has helped you out, please support us with a star 🌟

</h1>
This library is a React Native bridge around native photo editor libraries. It allows you to edit any photo by providing below set of features:

-   _**Cropping**_
-   _**Adding Images -Stickers-**_
-   _**Adding Text with Colors**_
-   _**Drawing with Colors**_
-   _**Scaling and Rotating Objects**_
-   _**Deleting Objects**_
-   _**Saving to Photos and Sharing**_
-   _**Cool Animations**_

# Introduction

`@thienmd/react-native-image-editor` is a fork of the deprecated `react-native-photo-editor`. The original library had not been updated for a while and had several limitations, including inconsistent user interfaces between iOS and Android.

Seeing the need for a more maintained and consistent library, I decided to fork `react-native-photo-editor` and create `@thienmd/react-native-image-editor`.

The main goals of this library are:

-   **Maintainability:** As the maintainer of this library, I aim to keep it up-to-date with the latest versions of React Native and the native photo editor libraries.

-   **Consistency:** This library aims to provide a consistent user interface across both iOS and Android platforms. This not only provides a better user experience, but also makes it easier for developers to use.

## 📱 Demo

| iOS                                      | Android                                      |

## Migrating from react-native-photo-editor

If you're currently using `react-native-photo-editor` and want to switch to this library, you can follow these steps:

1. **Uninstall the old library.** Run `npm uninstall react-native-photo-editor` or `yarn remove react-native-photo-editor`, depending on whether you're using npm or yarn.

2. **Install this library.** Run `npm install @thienmd/react-native-image-editor` or `yarn add @thienmd/react-native-image-editor`.

3. **Update your JavaScript files.** Replace all instances of `import PhotoEditor from 'react-native-photo-editor'` with `import ImageEditor from '@thienmd/react-native-image-editor'`.

4. **Update your Podfile.** If you're using iOS, make the following changes in your Podfile:

    Replace `pod 'RNPhotoEditor', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-photo-editor'` with `pod 'RNImageEditor', :path => '../node_modules/@thienmd/react-native-image-editor'`.

    Replace `pod 'iOSPhotoEditor', :git => 'https://github.com/prscX/photo-editor', :branch => 'master'` with `pod 'iOSPhotoEditor', :git => 'https://github.com/ThienMD/photo-editor', :branch => 'master'`.

5. **Run `pod install`.** If you're using iOS, run `pod install` in your `ios` directory to install the new library.

Please note that the API of this library might be different from `react-native-photo-editor`. Make sure to update your code to use the new API.

## 📖 Getting started

`$ yarn add @thienmd/react-native-image-editor`

> This library is supported React Native V61 and above

-   **iOS**

> **iOS Prerequisite:** Please make sure `CocoaPods` is installed on your system

    - Add the following to your `Podfile` -> `ios/Podfile` and run pod update:

```
  use_native_modules!

  pod 'RNPhotoEditor', :path => '../node_modules/@thienmd/react-native-image-editor/ios'

  use_frameworks! :linkage => :static
  pod "iOSPhotoEditor", :git => "https://github.com/ThienMD/photo-editor", :branch => "master"

  post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      if target.name.include?('iOSPhotoEditor')
        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
          config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '5'
        end
      end
    end
  end

  # Follow [Flipper iOS Setup Guidelines](https://fbflipper.com/docs/getting-started/ios-native)
  # This is required because iOSPhotoEditor is implemented using Swift and we have to use use_frameworks! in Podfile
  $static_framework = ['FlipperKit', 'Flipper', 'Flipper-Folly',
    'CocoaAsyncSocket', 'ComponentKit', 'Flipper-DoubleConversion',
    'Flipper-Glog', 'Flipper-PeerTalk', 'Flipper-RSocket', 'Yoga', 'YogaKit',
    'CocoaLibEvent', 'OpenSSL-Universal', 'boost-for-react-native']

  pre_install do |installer|
    Pod::Installer::Xcode::TargetValidator.send(:define_method, :verify_no_static_framework_transitive_dependencies) {}
    installer.pod_targets.each do |pod|
        if $static_framework.include?(pod.name)
          def pod.build_type;
            Pod::BuildType.static_library
          end
        end
      end
  end

```

-   Please make sure [**Flipper iOS Setup Guidelines**](https://fbflipper.com/docs/getting-started/ios-native/) steps are added to Podfile, since iOSPhotoEditor is implemented using Swift and we have to use use_frameworks! in Podfile

-   If using React Native Firebase v6+, please see `Troubleshooting` section for a known issue before moving further.

-   Add below property to your info.list

```
	<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Application needs permission to write photos...</string>

	<!-- If you are targeting devices running on iOS 10 or later, you'll also need to add: -->
	<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
	<string>iOS 10 needs permission to write photos...</string>
```

-   **Android**

-   Please add below script in your build.gradle

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        ...
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        ...
    }
}
```

-   Add below activity in your app activities:

`<activity android:name="com.ahmedadeltito.photoeditor.PhotoEditorActivity" />
<activity android:name="com.yalantis.ucrop.UCropActivity" />`

-   To save image to the public external storage, you must request the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission in your manifest file:

`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />`

## ⛄️ Stickers

If you want stickers, please add them to your native project:

-   **iOS:** Add stickers to iOS Resources folder
-   **Android:** Add stickers to app `drawable` folder

> Refer Example project for the same.

## 💻 Usage

```
import ImageEditor from '@thienmd/react-native-image-editor'

ImageEditor.Edit({
    path: RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath + "/photo.jpg"
});
```

> -   Purpose of this library is to edit photos which are within app sandbox, we recommend to move captured image to app sandbox then using RNFS share image path with library for the edit.

> -   Example: If we capture image through cameraRoll then we should first move image to app sandbox using RNFS then share app storage path with the editor.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If using React Native Firebase v6+ or facing any of the following issues: [#104](https://github.com/ThienMD/react-native-image-editor/issues/104), [#93](https://github.com/ThienMD/react-native-image-editor/issues/93)

-   Add the following to your `podfile -> ios/podfile` and run `pod install`

```
pre_install do |installer|
  installer.pod_targets.each do |pod|
    if pod.name.start_with?('RNFB')
      def pod.build_type;
        Pod::BuildType.static_library
      end
    end
  end
end
```

-   If the above doesn't work, try the following and and re-run `pod install`:

As [@react-native-firebase documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/#allow-ios-static-frameworks) you should add following to top of the Podfile for Allow iOS Static Frameworks

```
$RNFirebaseAsStaticFramework = true
```
